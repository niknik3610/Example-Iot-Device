# NOSHP Example Smart Home Device
An example Smart Home Device meant to be used in conjunction with the [NOSHP Smart Home server](https://github.com/niknik3610/IoT_Platform)

***Note: You will need to change the ip address in 'example_config.toml' to the server's IP address for this to work. The server's IP is printed at server startup.***
